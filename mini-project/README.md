## Full Stack Recipe Finder Web Application

### Introduction

This report outlines the design, implementation, and key features of a full-stack Recipe Finder web application utilizing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The application allows users to search for recipes based on keywords, filter and sort recipes, view detailed recipe information, and save favorite recipes for future reference. The backend is implemented using Node.js with Express.js framework, MongoDB for data storage, and the frontend is developed using React.

### Design Overview

#### MVC Architecture

The application follows the MVC architecture:
- **Model**: Represents the data structure. In this application, MongoDB serves as the model for storing recipe data and user information.
- **View**: Represents the presentation layer. React components are used for the frontend view, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user requests and updating the model accordingly. In the backend, Express.js controllers manage the routing and business logic.

### Backend Implementation

#### Dependencies
- Express.js: Used for building the backend server and handling HTTP requests.
- MongoDB: Serves as the database for storing recipe data and user information.
- CORS: Middleware used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing requests from the frontend to the backend server.

#### Routes
- **/api/recipes**: GET route to fetch recipes based on search queries, filters, and sorting options.
- **/api/recipes/:id**: GET route to retrieve detailed information about a specific recipe.
- **/api/users/:userId/recipes**: GET route to fetch saved recipes for a specific user.
- **/api/users/:userId/recipes**: POST route to save a recipe to a user's collection.

#### Controllers
- **RecipeController**: Handles requests related to fetching recipes and retrieving detailed recipe information.
- **UserController**: Manages user-related requests such as fetching saved recipes and saving new recipes.

### Frontend Implementation

#### Dependencies
- React: Used for building the user interface.
- Axios: Library for making HTTP requests to the backend API.

#### Components
- **SearchBar**: Component for entering search queries.
- **RecipeList**: Component for displaying a list of recipes.
- **RecipeCard**: Component for displaying individual recipe information.
- **FilterOptions**: Component for selecting filtering and sorting options.
- **SavedRecipes**: Component for displaying and managing saved recipes.

### Best Practices

#### Separation of Concerns
The application separates concerns between the model, view, and controller, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

#### RESTful API Design
Backend routes follow RESTful principles, providing a clear and consistent API interface.

#### Error Handling
Error handling middleware is implemented in the backend to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful responses to the client.

### Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of the MVC architecture and its application in full-stack development.
- Proficiency in building RESTful APIs using Express.js.
- Experience in integrating MongoDB for data storage and management.
- Familiarity with React for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- Application of best practices in software development, including separation of concerns and RESTful API design.

### Conclusion

The full-stack Recipe Finder web application, built using the MVC architecture, provides users with a seamless experience for searching, discovering, and saving recipes. By leveraging React for the frontend and Express.js with MongoDB for the backend, the application offers a robust and scalable solution for recipe management. Through the implementation of best practices and adherence to MVC principles, the application achieves a high level of maintainability, scalability, and user satisfaction.
