Introduction to the server side: Welcome to the MDN beginner's server-side programming course! In this first article, we look at server-side programming from a high level, answering questions such as "what is it?", "how does it differ from client-side programming?", and "why it is so useful?". After reading this article you'll understand the additional power available to websites through server-side coding.
        Prerequisites: 	A basic understanding of what a web server is.
        Objective: 	To gain familiarity with what server-side programming is, what it can do, and how it differs from client-side programming.
        
        Most large-scale websites use server-side code to dynamically display different data when needed, generally pulled out of a database stored on a server and sent to the client to be displayed via some code (e.g. HTML and JavaScript).
        
        Perhaps the most significant benefit of server-side code is that it allows you to tailor website content for individual users. Dynamic sites can highlight content that is more relevant based on user preferences and habits. It can also make sites easier to use by storing personal preferences and information â€” for example reusing stored credit card details to streamline subsequent payments.
        
        It can even allow interaction with users of the site, sending notifications and updates via email or through other channels. All of these capabilities enable much deeper engagement with users.
        
        In the modern world of web development, learning about server-side development is highly recommended.
