                <h2>About The Event</h2>
                <p>In 2015, the United Nations set several ambitious sustainable development goals to be achieved in the next 15 years to make our world a better place for everyone: end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. Towards this objective, the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering is proud to conduct and organize the ICCIDS 2024 - 7th International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science on February 21 - 23, 2024.</p>
            
                <p>The conference provides an opportunity for researchers, engineers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss experimental and theoretical work in solving problems to achieve sustainable development goals through Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
        
                <p>This conference holds value for anyone with an interest in or involvement with Al and its diverse applications across various domains. It features expert talks provided by individuals from renowned institutions and organizations across the globe, presentations by young researchers. Notably, accepted papers presented at the conference will be incorporated into the conference proceedings and subsequently published as part of the prestigious Springer IFIP AICT (Advances in Information and Communication Technology) series.</p>
